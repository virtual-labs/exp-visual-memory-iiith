## Procedure
1) Present participants with a series of stimuli, such as letters or numbers, one at a time on the screen.
2) Instruct participants to indicate whether the current stimulus matches the one presented "N" trials back.
3) Start with a low value of "N" (e.g., 1 or 2) and gradually increase the difficulty level in subsequent trials (e.g., 3, 4, or 5).
4) Participants should respond with a "Yes" if the current stimulus matches the one presented "N" trials back, or "No" otherwise.
5) Repeat each difficulty level multiple times to obtain reliable results.
6) Collect response data, including accuracy and reaction time, to assess participants' performance in the task.
