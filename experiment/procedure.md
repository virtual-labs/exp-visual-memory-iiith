## Procedure

**Step 1: Present a Series of Stimuli**  
You will be shown a sequence of stimuli (such as letters, numbers, or shapes) one at a time on the screen. Each stimulus will appear for a brief moment before the next one is displayed.

**Step 2: Indicate Matches**  
Your task is to identify whether the current stimulus matches the one that appeared **N trials back**. For example, in a 2-Back task, you will need to compare the current stimulus with the one presented two steps earlier.

**Step 3: Start with Easy Difficulty**  
The task will begin with a low value of **N** (e.g., 1 or 2). This will make it easier to keep track of the stimuli. As you progress, the difficulty will increase gradually, with higher values of **N** (e.g., 3, 4, or 5), requiring you to remember and compare more stimuli.

**Step 4: Respond with "Yes" or "No"**  
When a stimulus appears, decide if it matches the one you saw **N steps earlier**. If it does, click "Yes." If it does not match, click "No." Be sure to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.

**Step 5: Repeat Each Difficulty Level**  
Each difficulty level (i.e., each value of **N**) will be repeated multiple times to ensure accurate and reliable results. You'll be asked to complete the task at each level a few times before moving to a more difficult level.

**Step 6: Collect Response Data**  
Your responses will be recorded, including both the accuracy of your answers and the time it takes for you to respond. This data will help assess how well you are performing in the task and give insights into your working memory capacity.
