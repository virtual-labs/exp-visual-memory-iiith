## Theory
Working memory is a cognitive system that allows us to temporarily hold and manipulate information in our minds while performing complex tasks. It is crucial for a wide range of cognitive processes, including problem-solving, decision-making, and language comprehension. The N-Back task is a commonly used experimental paradigm to assess and measure working memory capacity.<br>
Working memory consists of several components. The central executive acts as the control center, directing attention and coordinating information processing. It is responsible for allocating cognitive resources to different tasks and strategies. Two subsidiary systems are involved in working memory: the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketchpad. The phonological loop deals with auditory information, such as spoken language, while the visuospatial sketchpad handles visual and spatial information.<br>
The N-Back task specifically targets the central executive and its ability to update and maintain information. In this task, participants are presented with a series of stimuli, such as numbers, letters, or shapes, one at a time. Their task is to indicate when the current stimulus matches the one that occurred N steps earlier in the sequence.<br>
For example, in a 2-Back task, participants must respond whenever the current stimulus matches the one presented two stimuli ago. This requires actively maintaining the stimuli in working memory and constantly updating the representation as new stimuli are presented. The difficulty of the task increases as the N value gets larger, as it requires participants to keep track of a longer sequence of stimuli.<br>
The N-Back task serves as a measure of working memory capacity and performance. By examining participants' accuracy and reaction time in identifying matches, researchers can gain insights into the limits and capabilities of working memory. Individuals with higher working memory capacity are generally more accurate and faster in their responses, as they can effectively maintain and manipulate a larger amount of information in their working memory.<br>
The N-Back test is used to assess and train working memory. Working memory is important for many cognitive functions, such as reasoning, problem-solving, and learning. Some studies have suggested that training with the N-Back test can improve fluid intelligence, which is the ability to reason and solve novel problems.
